# Overview  
MCP-Debug is a comprehensive debugging tool for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It solves the critical problem of debugging and testing MCP server implementations by providing a client that can connect to MCP servers, inspect their capabilities, and execute their functions interactively. This tool is essential for developers working with MCP servers who need to validate functionality, test integrations, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

# Core Features  
## Multi-Mode Operation
- **Normal Mode**: Connect to MCP servers and monitor for real-time changes and notifications
- **REPL Mode**: Interactive command-line interface for exploring MCP capabilities with live feedback
- **MCP Server Mode**: Expose debugging functionality as an MCP server for integration with AI assistants

## MCP Protocol Support
- **SSE Transport**: Connect to MCP servers via Server-Sent Events for real-time communication
- **JSON-RPC**: Full JSON-RPC message logging and communication protocol support
- **Tool Inspection**: List, describe, and execute available tools with JSON arguments
- **Resource Management**: Browse and retrieve resources from connected MCP servers
- **Prompt Handling**: Access and execute prompts with dynamic arguments

## Developer Experience
- **Interactive REPL**: User-friendly command interface with help system and auto-completion hints
- **Flexible Configuration**: Command-line flags for various operational modes and logging levels
- **Integration Ready**: Native support for Cursor IDE and other AI assistant integrations

# User Experience  
## Primary Users
- **MCP Server Developers**: Testing and validating their server implementations
- **AI Assistant Integrators**: Debugging MCP connections and tool executions
- **DevOps Engineers**: Monitoring MCP server health and performance

## Key User Flows
1. **Development Testing**: Developer starts REPL mode, lists available tools, tests tool execution with various inputs
2. **Integration Debugging**: DevOps connects to live MCP server, monitors notifications, validates resource access
3. **AI Assistant Setup**: Integrator configures MCP-Debug as server mode for AI assistant integration

# UI/UX Considerations
- Clean command-line interface with colored output (optional)
- Comprehensive help system with examples
- JSON formatting for readable output
- Error handling with clear diagnostic messages

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First
1. **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Core JSON-RPC and SSE handling must be established
2. **CLI Framework**: Cobra command structure provides the foundation for all user interactions
3. **Basic Client Mode**: Normal mode connection enables testing of MCP server communication

## Progressive Feature Building
4. **REPL Foundation**: Interactive mode builds upon basic client functionality
5. **Tool Execution**: Command processing enables actual MCP tool testing
6. **Resource & Prompt Support**: Extends tool functionality to complete MCP protocol coverage
7. **MCP Server Mode**: Reverse functionality leverages existing protocol implementation

## Polish and Integration
8. **Configuration Management**: Flexible deployment options
9. **Documentation & Examples**: User onboarding and integration guides
10. **Testing & Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage and error handling

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **MCP Protocol Complexity**: Mitigate with comprehensive JSON-RPC library usage and thorough testing
- **Real-time Communication**: Address SSE reliability with connection retry logic and timeout handling
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensure Go build system handles platform-specific requirements

## MVP Scoping
- **Feature Creep**: Focus on core debugging functionality first, defer advanced features
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with basic stdio transport, expand to complex transports later
- **User Experience**: Balance feature completeness with usability in initial release

## Resource Constraints  
- **Development Time**: Prioritize MVP features that provide immediate value
- **Testing Coverage**: Focus on critical path testing for MCP protocol compliance
- **Documentation**: Emphasize examples and integration guides over comprehensive API docs
